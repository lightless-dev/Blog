As you should know, lightLess has only like 5 levels. (And our developers are too lazy to actually make some on their own.) So, `d-445`(founder) made this new level proposal system. So you can go in, choose a slot, and start editing. next you can backup to your computer, get it to us(idk how) and we'll consider adding it in.

## So here's how.

1. Go to the [propose editor](https://lightless-dev.github.io/Propose).
2. Go to a slot.
3. Press `e` on your keyboard. This opens the editor, or closes it..
> ### What do the sliders mean?
> Brush is which block you are placing, Brush size is the size.

### Block Table

|#|Block|Type|Description|
|---:|:---|:---|:---|
|2|Space|Air|Filler block. It's just air, and it's used to remove a block.|
|3|Square|Solid|Just a box. It's harmless. but beware! don't crash the editor. spawn the player away from it or the game may crash.|
|4|Spike|Danger|A spike. Obviously dangerous. Kills the player just by touching it.|
|5,6,7,8|Ramps|Solid|A box, but climbable. Each ramp points in a different direction.|
|9|Finish Flag|Entity|The end of your level, if a player touches it, the level ends.| 


Use `WASD` to move camera in editor.

Done? hit `e`, playtest your level, and then click `SAVE SESSION`. Now your session is saved. your slots should be saved. hit this before exiting with the menu button. 

To send the level to us, you should click `BACKUP LEVEL AS FILE`. Then send your .liglss file to us. You can make a pull request at our [resource page](https://github.com/lightless-dev/resource). We'll check out your level.

Other than that, thanks for trying to make levels! we'll value your level.

###### We'll give you credit in credits screen.
