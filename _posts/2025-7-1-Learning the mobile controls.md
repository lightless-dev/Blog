If you play lightLess a lot (nobody) then you know we added mobile controls. (very annoying ones) I was about stop using my touchscreen for lightLess. Level 4 had to be edited just so you can play. Well, it was hard on keyboard anyways.

So here's the story of the mobile controls.

First adding them seemed easy. I just had to make a draggy thingy. It worked, But it was **SO ANNOYING!!!** So, i got rid of them and made better ones where you could acctually see the thing. It was better, but the player fell through it and the controls hid the screen a lot. So I made this double-side control that was small but playable. Maybe playable. Then  I took some time figuring out why mobile browsers made everything wierd.

And that's the end of this story.
